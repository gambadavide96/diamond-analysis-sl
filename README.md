# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction â€“ Statistical Learning Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project applies concepts learned in the *Statistical Learning* course through a practical case study using a rich and insightful dataset on **diamonds**. The primary goal is to explore and evaluate different statistical models to predict diamond prices based on their physical and qualitative attributes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Apply statistical learning techniques in a real-world scenario
* Investigate the relationship between diamond features and their prices
* Determine whether a **linear model** is suitable for price prediction
* Identify the most **influential variables** in determining the price

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains a variety of features that describe the physical characteristics of diamonds, such as:

* **Carat** (weight of the diamond)
* **Cut**, **Color**, **Clarity** (qualitative assessments)
* **Dimensions** (x, y, z)
* **Depth**, **Table** (proportions)

These features make the dataset ideal for evaluating the predictive power of different variables and modeling strategies.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The analysis involves:

* Data exploration and preprocessing
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model selection (e.g., linear regression, regularization methods, tree-based models)
* Evaluation through appropriate error metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²)
* Interpretation of model coefficients and variable importance

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **R**

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

* A comparison of different models for price prediction
* Insights on which diamond characteristics impact price the most
* A critical evaluation of model performance and assumptions


## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project serves as a practical exercise in statistical learning, offering both technical and business-oriented insights into diamond pricing. By analyzing the relationship between features and price, we aim to draw meaningful conclusions and develop robust predictive models.
